tested with Lean 4.0

Use the `#check` command to check whether the Lean core library has the notation for the type you want to use.

== To run ==
```
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/scratch --workdir /scratch lean4onubuntu lean check_Nat.v4.lean         
Nat : Type
```

== explanation ==

Unicode "N" isn't supported in command-line Lean; the following would fail:
```
check â„•
```
Unicode notation can be supported by adding `import Mathlib.Init.Data.Nat.Notation` to the top of this script
 as per <https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/377024-ATOMS-Lab/topic/docker.20container.20for.20Lean/near/371617041>
-/

-- instead of "\Nat", in command-line Lean use
#check Nat
